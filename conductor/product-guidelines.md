# Product Guidelines - site-monitor

## Voice and Tone
- **Professional and Technical**: Clear, direct, and focused on reliability. Use precise terminology when describing monitoring states.

## Design Principles
- **Performance First**: Scans and UI interactions must be snappy.
- **Design Stability**: Maintain the current design of the site. Avoid applying new "Luxury Dark" themes or Glassmorphism unless explicitly requested.
- **User Safety**: Ensure sensitive data (like API keys) is never exposed in logs or UI.
